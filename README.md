# demofs — A Linux Filesystem (Work in Progress)

**demofs** is a custom Linux filesystem module written in C. It aims to provide a reliable and efficient filesystem implementation with a clean, maintainable codebase.

⚠️ **Status:** Still in the making — features, architecture, and interfaces are subject to change until the first stable release.

## Goals

* Provide a functional and efficient filesystem for Linux.
* Support standard file and directory operations.
* Maintain compatibility with the Linux Virtual Filesystem Switch (VFS) layer.
* Implement robust metadata and attribute handling.
